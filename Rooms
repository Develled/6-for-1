Lab Puzzle

In This Room: Kyler (Science prof), Athena (Hero), Grayson (Villain)

Word to spell - Vatican

Riddle: A home to few but a refuge to many, the world's smallest country bestows blessings a plenty

***23 - Vanadium (V) - hard, silvery-grey, malleable transition metal
*85 - Astatine (At) - It is the rarest naturally occurring element in the Earth's crust, occurring only as the decay product of various heavier elements. All of astatine's isotopes are short-lived; the most stable is astatine-210, with a half-life of 8.1 hours. (Found in Vacuum Chamber)
**53 - Iodine (I) - it exists as a lustrous, purple-black non-metallic solid at standard conditions that melts to form a deep violet liquid at 114 degrees Celsius (Talking to Athena)
*20 - Calcium (Ca) - Calcium is a silvery-white, soft metal that tarnishes rapidly in air and reacts with water. (Found in Skeleton)
*7 - Nitrogen (N) - Pure nitrogen is an unreactive colorless diatomic gas at room temperature (Found on Lab Bench)

Riddle above door, 5 slots for test tubes of elements. 8 total test tubes to be found

**11 - Sodium (Na) - Salt (Talking to Grayson)
*73 - Tantalum (Ta) - Tantalum is a rare, hard, blue-gray, lustrous transition metal that is highly corrosion-resistant. The chemical inertness of tantalum makes it a valuable substance for laboratory equipment, and as a substitute for platinum (Found in Cabinet with science equipment)
**39 - Yttrium (Y) - Yttrium is a soft, silver-metallic, lustrous and highly crystalline (Talking to Kyler)


*4 elements you find by searching (Lab Bench, Skeleton, Vacuum Chamber, Cabinet)
**3 by interacting with companions
***1 given when entering room


-------

Vanadium on the table as you go in (no need to search, auto pickup). Test tubes all have element symbol + number on them.

Vanadium Scene:
You were the last to step in the room, you saw Athena and Kyler looking at a table
‘What is it’
‘Vanadium’ - Kyler
‘...’
‘It’s a transition metal, I’ve never seen it in person before’ - Kyler
‘Then how do you know what it is?’
Kyler shows you the test tube more closely, there's a small label on it that says V with a small 23 in the top corner
‘V is the element symbol for Vanadium, I had to study the periodic table for my degree. Hold onto this would you. We don’t know what around here will be useful’
‘Uhm, okay’ you said as you reached out your hand.

 **V - Vanadium added to inventory**

Astatine Scene:
‘Hey Kyler, what element has a symbol ‘At’ and the number 85?’
‘Astatine … where do you see that??’ - Kyler
‘Here’ You handed him the test tube
‘...this can’t be possible….’ Kyler mutters
‘What? Why not? Is everything okay?’
*silence*
‘..Kyler?’
‘Yea sorry, I just.. I don’t know what to say’ - Kyler ‘Astatine is extremely rare .. all the Astatine isotopes have extremely short half lifes. This can’t be the real thing..’
Kyler continues to stare at the test tube in shock as you slowly back away

**At - Astatine added to inventory**

Sodium Scene:
You walk over to Grayson who’s standing by himself in the corner
‘Hey Grayson, manager to find anything?’
He looks up at you and without saying anything and extends out his arm, holding a test tube.
‘What’s this?’ You ask as you take the test tube from him
“Sodium.’ He mutters as he turns away
It doesn’t look like you’ll get anything else out of him

**Na - Sodium added to inventory**

Final Puzzle (Room relates to Grayson?) 
Large Auditorium
All burnt up
Dead bodies in the middle of the room that (seemingly) burnt to death
If no clues found - Athena goes on despair ridden rampage leading to bad end

If only Athena dialogue completed, group turns on Grayson (knows too much about the situation) bad end

If Athena + Grayson dialogue completed but no clues found, turn on other char (bad end)

If Athena +Grayson dialogue completed + all clues found, find out real killer, good end
